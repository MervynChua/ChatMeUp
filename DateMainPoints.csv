""Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,"" he told the Times. 

Shale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. 

Hyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. 

Sanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. 

Based on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. 

GAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. 

Though it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. 

Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term

Posters with colorful images of Elian Karel and Juliana Vann were reminders of the heavy toll already paid by leaders and innocents.  Karel was the prior leader of the Protectors of Kronos before his premature death in 2009.  His death, thought to be a murder by many, prompted annul rallies to bring the message of the Protectors of Kronos to the public.
